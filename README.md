# Caleb Jordan's Portfolio Page - Bootstrap (Week 3)

## Overview
Welcome to the Week 3 update of my portfolio in the front-end web development course. This iteration showcases my growing skills, with a focus on building a Bootstrap-based portfolio.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a portfolio page using the Bootstrap framework to enhance design and responsiveness.
- Create a visually appealing layout to display skills learned up to this point in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- Update portfolio over time, replacing placeholders with real projects as they are completed.

## Deployment
